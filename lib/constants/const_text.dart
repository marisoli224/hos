TrueBeam can be used in treatment of all cancers that require radiotherapy and it irradiates tumors that are smaller than 0.5 mm. TrueBeam is preferred especially for treatment of small tumors in brain or that are nearby risky organs in whole body.
TrueBeam STX is used for radiotherapy of tumors in organs, such as lungs, liver and breasts that require respiratory monitoring. Since radiation beams are delivered while respiratory motions are monitored (respiratory gating), location of tumor can be irradiated at high dose.""";

It is used to grade tumors of digestive system and adjacent organs (stomach, intestines, gall bladder, liver, and pancreas) and to assess lesions located immediately beneath the lining of digestive system.

EUS allows biopsying tumors that begin in digestive system and nearby organs and draining certain formations, such as cysts.

It is almost identical to a conventional endoscopy. It can assess both upper and lower digestive system. It is superior to other sonographic modalities in diagnosis of cancers of esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon and biliary tree and assessment of vascular structures in these organs.""";

This method is primarily used in breast cancer operations as well as pancreas, colon and soft tissue cancer surgeries. Location of tumor is irradiated at high dose in breast cancers, after the breast tumor is surgically removed.

Radiotherapy procedure is performed by radiation oncology team during the operation.

Single-dose radiotherapy enables irradiating the tumor site, as the target can be directly seen in the surgical procedure. Patient's skin is not exposed to radiation, as only the tumor bed is irradiated, and thus, potential future dermal side effects are minimized.

“Neuro-navigation and computer-based surgical guidance has become a standard part of neurosurgery practices today. The StealthStation helps me ensure complete resections as well as helps me minimize approach-related complications,” says neurosurgeon Colin Buchanan, MD, of the Medical Center of Aurora in Colorado. “I believe many neurosurgeons will be excited to see what the newest version of this technology will offer.”""";


   static const String MRI = """It is used especially in brain surgeries to inform the surgeon on size and direction of the tumors that are not easily accessible. Thus, the surgeon decides either to terminate or continue the operation.

The device is installed in an area that is connected to the operating theater. It allows acquiring images of the anesthetized patient while the surgery is continued, when needed.

This method is of vital importance, especially in brain surgeries. The surgeon can perform necessary tests without reanimating the patient or suturing the surgical site at any point of the surgery when required. The need for a second operation is decreased, since certain risks are eliminated, such as inability to completely clear the residual material, damage to functioning areas or operating on wrong sites.

The GE Healthcare MRI 1.5T training program is designed to provide the attendee with the knowledge to operate the 1.5T MRI systems and to successfully use the new applications. The course will prepare the MRI Technologist for onsite applications training. It may also enhance the learning experience for those attending after their onsite applications training.

The patient is exposed to 30 percent less radiation and high-quality images are acquired when compared to other mammography scanners.
